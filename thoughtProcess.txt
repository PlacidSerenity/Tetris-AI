Early thought process:
if: we have a gap
[Currently undone]
elif: we get an I piece and there exists one or columns that are 3 or more blocks lower than others, place the I in vertically.
elif: we have two consecutive columns that are one or more columns lower than the others:
    if: the two consecutive columns that are one or more lower than the right column, we can put the Z or J piece in vertically.
    if: the two consecutive columns have the right column lower by one or more blocks than the left column, put the S or L piece vertically into the hole.
if: we have a row or more that allows a piece to fit perfectly (and therefore cancel out):
    - bypass reservation and put a piece there only if a piece can be out only there
    else:
        leave spot empty and create a reservation at that space such that when such piece arrives, the spot will be cleared and allowed for the piece.

Unanswered questions:
- In what scenarios are we allowed to put an I piece horizontally?
- When a game starts with a S or Z piece, which pieces are best to slide into the gap?
- Figure out how when and how we decide T spins?
- Different modes (eg: clearing rows as fast as possible when the game speeds up or trying to clear 4 rows as much as possible)?

Game conditions:
At any point there must
- a pair of consecutive columns with height difference 0.
- a pair of consecutive columns with height difference 1.
- only one column must with height difference larger or equal to 3 compared to its surrounding columns.

Move cost considerations:
- hole creation
- block off a column (hole creation but a bit more specific)
- rows cleared (clearing a single row when if another piece could clear more and lead to more points)
- making higher height difference between columns (to be discussed)
- not leaving space for O piece
- making a smaller heigh different between columns (to be discussed)
